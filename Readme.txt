-->The source code is named as Assignment.py
-->Training data is in brestcancer_train.csv file and Test data
   is in brestcancer_test.csv file
-->Make sure those 2 '.csv' files are in same folder location
   when running the source code.
-->The Activation function is 'sigmoid' and we need to change it to 'tanh'
   and 'Relu'.(I have indicated in comments where to write the 
   activation function) 
-->Also the 'no.of iterations' and 'learning rate' are '1000' and '0.05'
   by default and we need to change them as well.(I have indicated in
   comments where to change them)
