A Neural Network with two hidden layers is designed for performing classification. The input data is taken from UCIML repository and the Neural Network is trained on that input data to perform classification function. Training data is in brestcancer_train.csv file and Test data is in brestcancer_test.csv file.  The Activation functions used are 'sigmoid', 'tanh' and 'relu' and results are compared. Also, the 'no.of iterations' and 'learning rate' are '1000' and '0.05' by default.
