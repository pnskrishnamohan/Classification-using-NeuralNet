I have designed a Neural Network for performing classification. I took the input data from UCIML repository and trained the Neural Network on that input data to perform classification function. I have implemented a 2 hidden layer neurons for this function. Training data is in brestcancer_train.csv file and Test data is in brestcancer_test.csv file. The Activation functions used are 'sigmoid', 'tanh' and 'relu' and results are compared. Also, the 'no.of iterations' and 'learning rate' are '1000' and '0.05' by default. The results and analysis are indicated in results file.
